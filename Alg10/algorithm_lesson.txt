There are lot of hash function implemented in map for random choosing 
    (for aware of worst case as much as possible as in quicksort random pivot)

Unordered map is "unordered" :), but map is ordered by using BST
map, set and etc. is assosiative because the key is assosiative with the place (index)

How should be hash function
1) Determinism - everytype get same result for same value, object
2) Uniformity - equal distribution
3) New-reversibility - one way hashing (for security);
4) Efficiency - for productifity

Hash algorithms for string: fnv_1a (polinominal), jb2 (shifting)

Sliding window teqnique: using for solve array subsequence problems
