Invariant - tstmarit statement, vory chi poxum amboxdz algorithmi katarman yntacqum, for each iteration:

Bubble sort steps is equal = n * (n - 1) / 2 => O(n^2) is Order of grouth:
Selection sort steps is equal = n * (n - 1) / 2 => O(n^2)
Insert sort steps is equal = n * (n - 1) / 2 => O(n^2)

In insertion sort you do less operations than selection and bubble sort because insertion sort may not go full back, 
but in selection and buuble sort you must check all vector:

Binary search O(log2(n))

Tasks:

1. read in cppreferecne std::lower_bound, std::upper_bound, std::equal_range (also implemente them)
2. In sort vector find last element with target value (with BS)
