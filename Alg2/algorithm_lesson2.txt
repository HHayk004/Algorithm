divide and conquer
is the technique that divide the problem into same subproblems and how much, that the subproblem become trivial.
merge sort divide array into subarrays and try to solve them until it reaches the arrays of one lengths and after merges this arrays
merge sort complexity is O(nlog(n))
for arr.length = 16: 7, 8, 3, 9, 10, 4, 1, 11, 12, 5, 13, 14, 6, 2, 0 of calling merge
proofs of merge sorts
1) tree method (graphik tsari)
2) substiturtion method (T erovna)
Tasks
implement mergesort: and compare to Insertion sort
